The Google Summer of Code(GSOC) will be back in 2015. On October 6th, Google confirmed that GSOC will be happening in 2015, as explained in great detail at this blog [post][googleblog]. Here is an excerpt where they asked all of us to communicate further about it, hence the motivation of writing this post. 

> Spread the word to your friends! If you know of a university student that would be 
> interested in working on open source projects this summer, or if you know of 
> an organization that might want to mentor students to work on their open source projects, 
> please direct them to our Google Summer of Code 2015 website where they can find 
> our timeline along with the FAQs. Stay tuned for more details coming soon!


With that good news we have another good news. We are expecting to mentor students in Python programming and in creating a Jasper module as a project. We believe that with this project the students will be able to gain valuable insights from our expereience and they would prove valuable in their pursuit of a project at [GSOC, 2015][gsoc]. Not to forget to mention, the mentors for this student program have been GSOCers in previous years themselves, [Ashish Sharma][kartaa] in 2010 and [Mayank Juneja][mayankjuneja] in 2011.

If you are a student, we hope you will try to get a project at GSOC 2015 and we also welcome you to Next Craft to contribute to our projects. Take a look at the source code we have made public [Nextcraft’s GitHub page][nextcraft]. We invite collaborations on all these projects. If you have questions, you can contact us at {{ site.email }}.
