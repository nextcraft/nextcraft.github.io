As promised earlier, we are ready with the version one of our Python Primer. It should come of help if you have just started learning python. If you are a student who wants to take part in JMP student program, please take a look at the presntation.

Although, we do not think that the students would need to know Python well in advance to work with us, however if you can spare some time to look at the Primer and the resouces mentioned at the end of it then that would be helpful in your own project's execution.

So, the python primer is now available for [download][primer] and we are waiting for your project proposals in the program. Good Luck.
