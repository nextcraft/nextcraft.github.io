At Next Craft we are building a learning and development group with a focus on Open Source innovation. Through our open source projects we hope to create products and services that along with having a positive impact, advance learning of the members and also expand opportunities available to them.

You can find the source code for all Next Craft projects at [github.com/nextcraft](https://github.com/nextcraft).
