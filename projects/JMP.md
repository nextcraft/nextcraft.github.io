In this project, we will be partering with school students to develop modules for the upcoming open source project [Jasper][Jasper].  Since, the client is right now written in `Python`, so one needs to write new modules in Python. But making modules for the Jasper Client is fun and easy with its simple api. 

Please have a look at the project source at [Nextcraft's JMP][JMP] at Github.

We will be updating this page with more information as it becomes available.
