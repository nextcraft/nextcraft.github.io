In this project, we are developing modules for the [Jasper][Jasper] project. These modules although are being developed for [Jasper][Jasper] but the ideas on which they will be created will have the potential to be ported to some other Jasper like platform. 
At present, the Jasper Client is written in `Python`, so one would be required to write new modules in Python only. Making these modules for the Jasper Client is fun and easy as detailed in their documentation. You can also see an example  Coursera Public API based module we have created in [Nextcraft's JMP][JMP] at Github.

In order to give a boost to our development of modules and increase our understanding of Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing, we will be working with school students to develop Jasper modules. If you are a student who is interested in working with us, please checkout the following program details.


We would be working on different modules ideas for Jasper in this program. We have quite a few ideas from our daily deliberations at our hand, but new module ideas are also welcome. If you are interested in working on a module with our guidance and make it a part of this project, kindly let us know.

On successful completion of the modules project, we would also be hosting the project details at our website. Also, once we have a substantial number of completed modules at our hand to test, we will be sponsoring the creation of a Jasper, as detailed on [Jasper][Jasper] project website. The student program as will be requiring mentorship and hence will follow a program timeline.

### Run 1
Since we have limited mentorship resource at our disposal, only limited students could be supported. The exact number will depend on the number of applications received, amount of mentorship needed in each module, but an expected upper limit is of 5. 

### Mentors for Run1
1. Ashish Sharma [kartaa][mentor1]
2.
